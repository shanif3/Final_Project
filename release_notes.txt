 2. Changes with respect to previous version:
      * Library features (most of them are inherit from the XBee Java Library):
        * Support for ZigBee, 802.15.4, DigiMesh, Point-to-Multipoint, Wi-Fi,
          Cellular and Thread XBee devices.
        * Support for API and API escaped operating modes.
        * Support for different communication interfaces with the XBee device.
          These include:
          * Bluetooth Low Energy.
          * USB host.
          * Digi's serial port.
        * Management of local (attached to the Android device) and remote XBee
          device objects.
        * Discovery of remote XBee devices that are associated to the same
          network as the local one.
        * Configuration of local and remote XBee devices:
          * Configure common parameters with specific setters and getters.
          * Configure any other parameter with generic methods.
          * Execute AT commands.
          * Apply configuration changes.
          * Write configuration changes.
          * Reset the device.
        * Transmission of data to all the XBee devices of the network or to a
          specific one.
        * Reception of data from remote XBee devices:
          * Data polling.
          * Data reception callback.
        * Reception of network status changes related to the local XBee device.
        * IO lines management:
          * Configure IO lines
          * Set IO line value.
          * Read IO line value.
          * Receive IO data samples from any remote XBee device of the network.
        * Support for explicit frames and application layer fields (Source
          endpoint, Destination endpoint, Profile ID, and Cluster ID).
        * Support for User Data Relay frames, allowing the communication
          between different interfaces (Serial, Bluetooth Low Energy and
          MicroPython).

      * Android application examples demonstrating some API specific features.
        * Configure XBee devices over Bluetooth Low Energy
        * Send and receive data over Bluetooth Low Energy to a micro-controller
          connected to the XBee serial interface.
        * Send and receive data over Bluetooth Low Energy to the XBee
          MicroPython interface.
        * Communicate with XBee devices over Bluetooth Low Energy and send data
          to other XBee interfaces
        * Usage of all the available options using a local XBee module
          connected to your Android device over USB host or serial interface.

      * Comprehensive online documentation including:
        * Getting Started Guide.
        * Users Guide.
        * API Reference Manual.
